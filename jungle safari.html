<p>The Sardar Patel Zoological Park, the latest tourist attraction in Gujarat located in close 
proximity to the Statue of Unity, is called a Jungle Safari because unlike other zoological parks,
 the park is created in an “open design”, which recreates the feel of a wildlife safari. 
The animals can be seen in their natural habitat, and not restricted to cages, unlike the other zoos. 
It is interesting to note that the zoo has many animals which have been imported from across the world.</p>

<p>There is an area called Abode of Carnivores, which houses only carnivorous animals. 
Golf carts are also available for taking a tour of the Sardar Patel Zoological Park. 
Much emphasis has been laid on ecological balance. 
There are more than 5 lakh plants in the zoo distributed across 7 levels. 
Animal models have also been placed at certain points which provide information about the fauna inside the park. 
Some of the animals inside the zoo are Royal Bengal Tigers, leopards, giraffe, zebras, rhinoceros, deer and antelopes.</p>
