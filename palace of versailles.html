<p>The Ch√¢teau de Versailles is the most famous castle in France. Built in the 17th century as a symbol 
of military power of France and as a demonstration of French supremacy in Europe, Versailles was the seat of 
political power in the Kingdom of France from 1682 to 1789. This huge complex of buildings, gardens and terraces 
is definitely a must for any visitor who will be captivated by exceptional accommodations, lavish decorations, 
furniture and gilded works of Renaissance art.
Visit Versailles: you will start by the State Apartments and the famous Hall of Mirrors, the Queen's chamber. 
Do not forget to stroll through the famous "French" gardens.</P>
