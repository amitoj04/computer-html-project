<p>Hawa Mahal, literally the Palace of Winds, was built in 1799 by the poet king Sawai Pratap Singh as a
 summer retreat for him and his family. It also served as a place where the ladies of the royal household 
could observe everyday life without being seen themselves. This unique five-storey structure is a blend of 
Hindu and Islamic architecture, and the exterior, with its small latticed windows (called jharokhas), 
resembles the crown of Lord Krishna. The windows also serve as an air-conditioner of sorts, blowing cool air 
throughout the palace, making it the perfect retreat during summers. Built from pink sandstone, 
the Hawa Mahal is Jaipurâ€™s iconic landmark and visitors can view its complete magnificence from outside, 
from across the road. However, it is also possible to climb right up to the top for a wonderful view from the windows.
 Today, the Mahal is maintained by the Archaeological Department of the Government of Rajasthan and also houses
 an archaeological museum in the courtyard.</P>
