<p>Nahargarh Fort sits proudly on a ridge of the Aravalli Hills, creating an impressive northern backdrop to the city
 of Jaipur. It was constructed during the reign of Jai Singh in 1734, and was later expanded in 1868.
 Nahargarh, which means abode of tigers, was a formidable barrier, defending Jaipur against attacking enemies.
 Within its walls, the fort houses Madhavendra Bhawan, the summer destination for the members of the royal family. 
Built by Sawai Madho Singh, the palace has 12 matching boudoirs for the queens, at the head of which is a suite 
for the king. They are all connected by corridors decorated with delicate murals. Even today the palace 
is a favoured spot for local picnickers. The fort looks brilliant when floodlit at night. Overlooking the city,
 it presents a glittering view of the city lights.</P>
