<p>The Royal Ontario Museum in downtown Toronto is one of the premier museums in the province, 
featuring a broad range of collections, from natural history and science to cultural exhibits from around the world.
Commonly referred to as the ROM, this museum underwent an expansion in 2007, which saw the addition of a modern and 
unique extension known as the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal. The building is now a mix of old and new architecture with a 
striking appearance.</P>
