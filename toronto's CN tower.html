<p>The CN Tower is one of Canada's most iconic structures, standing tall along the Toronto skyline. 
The 553-meter tower is lit up at night and can be seen from all over the city and surroundings 
at any time of day or night, but visitors will likely want to take a trip up the tower to fully experience it.
An elevator allows access to the observation deck and restaurant, located about three quarters of the way to the top.
 The view is astounding, looking out over the city and Lake Ontario. On clear days, it's possible to see all the way
 to the plume of mist rising off Niagara Falls. In the evening, looking out over the sparkling city lights 
is also an impressive sight.</P>
