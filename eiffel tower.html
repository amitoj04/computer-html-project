<p>It is  Built by Gustave Eiffel to commemorate the centenary of the French Revolution, it is presented at 
the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889. 324 meters high, it is one of the most visited monuments 
in the world with nearly 7 million visitors a year.
The first floor houses the Eiffel Tower 58 which extends over two levels, 58 meters above the ground as its 
name suggests. On the second floor, the view is the best at 115 meters because you have a diving view on the 
ground below. Finally on the 3rd floor at 275 meters, you can see what the office of Gustave Eiffel was. 
For the more adventurous one, it is possible to use the stairs and climb the steps (1,665 to the summit).
The ascent of the Eiffel Tower is a must to enjoy the magnificent view of Paris.</P>
