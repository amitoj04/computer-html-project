<p>A maze garden is a type of garden that is grown and landscaped in such a way that a maze exists. 
The Maze Garden in Gujarat is spread over three acres of land making it the largest such garden in India.
The garden has a pathway of about 2.1 kilometres. It has been designed in the shape of a ‘Shriyantra’, 
which is believed to bring positive energy to the place.
As many as 1.8 lakh saplings have been planted in the garden which has added to the aesthetic beauty of the landscape.</P>
