Recognising the importance of these medicinal plants, Arogya Van (Herbal Garden) is developed near Statue of Unity, 
which is spread over an area of about 17 acres. 
Arogya Van exhibits a wide range of medicinal plants and health-related landscapes. 
The aim of this attraction at Ekta Nagar, 
is to raise awareness about the important role played by plants in the wellness of human beings. 
Emphasis is also laid on Yoga, Ayurveda and Meditation for being an integral part of a person’s well-being.
The entry gate of Arogya Van has all 12 postures of Surya Namaskar of human size,
 to emphasise on the importance of yoga, which is to be practiced daily for healthy living. 
Digital information centre has been set-up to acknowledge visitors and make them understand the heritage and the 
importance of medicinal plants in our day to day life.
The key highlight at Arogya Van is the ‘Aushadh Manav.’
This is a giant three dimensional layout of a human body in a resting posture. 
Each human organ is represented by a medicinal plant which is beneficial for that particular organ. 
So these plants are planted on the specific part of the body to make the visitors understand the specific plants 
used for therapeutic treatment of that particular organ.
There are five gardens inside Arogya Van –Garden of Colours, Aroma Garden, Yoga Garden, Alba Garden and Leutea Garden.
