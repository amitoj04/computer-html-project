<p>Spread over an 80-kilometer stretch of the St. Lawrence River is a scenic natural area known as the 
Thousand Islands. The islands are on a granite shelf extending from the Canadian Shield to the Adirondack Mountains
 in the United States, with the US-Canada boundary actually running between the islands. 
It is one of the oldest and best-known holiday areas in Ontario, popular with cottagers, boaters, 
and those looking to get away from the cities of Southern Ontario during the hot summer months.</P>
