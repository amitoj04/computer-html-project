<p>The National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa houses some of the country's most important collections.
 It contains a particularly strong selection of works by Canadian artists, 
from the Group of Seven to Emily Carr and many other famous names. 
The gallery also displays important pieces by well-known international artists.
The National Gallery building is housed in an ultra-modern architectural masterpiece designed by Moshe Safdie.</P>
