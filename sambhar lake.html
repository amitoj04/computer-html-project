<p>Sambhar Lake is one of the largest inland salt lake and lies just 70 kms from Jaipur. 
It is an incredible landscape, almost resembling the Rann of Kutch, Gujarat. 
Apart from producing a large percentage of India's salt supply - it also an incredible place to spot birds 
including large flocks of flamingos. The views from the Shakambhari Mata Temple are breathtaking at sunset 
and one can spend hours in solitude. Another unique aspect is the Saltwork's own railway system built to transfer s
alt from the pans to the processing unit. A visit to the salt lake and a walk in the Sambhar town is also a must 
do activity. Devyani Kund, Sharmishtha Sarovar, Salt Museum, Circuit House, etc are also important places 
to visit in Sambhar. One can also visit religious sites Naraina & Bhairana on the way to Sambhar</P>
