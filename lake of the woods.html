<p>To discover Ontario's remote wilderness landscapes, one of the best places to visit is Lake of the Woods 
and the surround areas. This huge body of water lies on the lightly populated provincial borders of Manitoba 
and Ontario, and also dips into the state of Minnesota. This beautiful lake provides an incredibly scenic 
setting and pristine wilderness experience for those interested in venturing into the backcountry.
Many people have cottages on Lake of the Woods, but its distance from major cities and the size of the lake mean 
cottages are few and far between. It is also a prime destination for tourists who come to Canada to go on 
fishing trips.
Lake of the Woods provides excellent opportunities for boating, fishing, and simply escaping into the 
Canadian wilderness. Islands fringe the heavily indented Canadian north shore, while the south shore is 
flat, sandy, and marshy in places. Beginning in 1688, the lake provided trappers and voyageurs with a 
passage westwards.
The main town on Lake of the Woods is Kenora, Ontario.</P>
