<p>Parliament Hill in the nation's capital is where most visitors begin their sightseeing in Ottawa. 
The buildings reside in a lovely setting on a rise above the Ottawa River. The Peace Tower is the most obvious 
and the most photographed structure, standing more than 90 meters high between the Senate and the House of Commons.
In front of the Parliament buildings is the Centennial Flame. During the summer, visitors can see the Changing 
of the Guard on the lawn in front of the Houses of Parliament, while those who are lucky enough to be 
visiting Ottawa on July 1 can enjoy some of the biggest Canada Day celebrations in the country.</P>
