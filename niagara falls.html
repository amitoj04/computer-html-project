<p>Niagara Falls is Canada's most internationally recognized attraction, visited by millions of tourists each year.
 While there are actually three sets of falls, the largest section, known as Horseshoe Falls, 
drops approximately 57 meters, creating a great wall of water that stretches between Niagara Falls, 
Canada and Niagara Falls, USA. The falls are famous primarily for the large volume of water flowing over them,
 but combined with the huge drop, they are truly a magnificent sight.</P>
