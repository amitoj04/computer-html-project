<p>One of the most enduring symbols of Paris: Notre-Dame de Paris, also known as Notre Dame, 
a Roman Catholic cathedral is located on the eastern half of the Ile de la Cit√©. It is widely considered 
one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in France and Europe. Begun in 1163 and completed in 1345,
 this cathedral is a sight with its portals surrounded by his many sculptures and gargoyles that adorn the roof.
We advise you to walk around the cathedral, then go inside and climb the 387 steps to the top of the towers. 
The climb to the top of the towers can be exhausting, but you will get a panoramic view of the region and see the 
famous gargoyles up close.</P>
