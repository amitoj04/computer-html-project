<p>Find the best way to visit the "City of Light" enjoying a cruise on the Seine, especially at night.
 When the sun sets, the monuments are lit slowly. You get a panoramic view to the forefront so you can enjoy 
the beauty of Paris: Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, Pont Alexandre III and many more.
You can also enjoy a dinner cruise on the Seine aboard a boat. For about two hours, you are welcomed.
